# code-quiz-challenge
The purpose of this challenge was to build upon our foundational knowledge of JavaScript by applying Web APIs that enable the dynamic generation of HTML and CSS.

Observations:
- Very important to plan out the steps you will take to create this application. You cannot do certain steps before others. With that said, it is pretty much essential for you to work through this one step at a time.
- The usage of methods such as EventListener, createElement, and appendChild were key this is challenge.
- It is necessary to be mindful of your code in all three HTML, CSS, and JS files and how they interact with one another.
- A major aspect of this challenge was the balance between figuring out which solution made sense and the solution that would be most efficient. While there may have been other approaches that would've resulted in shorter code, my approach made sense to me and still worked. One of my future goals is to improve my code refactoring skills, but for now, I decided to prioritize functionality.
