# code-quiz-challenge
The purpose of this challenge was to build upon our foundational knowledge of JavaScript by applying Web APIs that enable the dynamic generation of HTML and CSS. We were introdcued to the concept of the DOM and had to figure how to use DOM properties in order create a Code Quiz that shows questions one at a time. The implementation of a timer was a great way to test our understanding of JavaScript elements and how they interact. At the end, we saved our quiz score with Local Storage, another useful tool when handling a browser that receives information. 

There were many instances throughout this challenge where I got stuck, and after analyzing the problem, things clicked in my head with an "ah-ha!" moment. I was introduced to many new features of JavaScript and expanded what I am capable of using.  The following is a list of observations I made throughout the process:

- It is very important to plan out the steps you will take to create this application. You cannot do certain steps before others. With that said, it is pretty much essential for you to work through this one step at a time. For instance, I had the make sure the dynamically-generated HTML elements were in place before I can set up a timer that responds to the buttons.
- The usage of methods such as EventListener, createElement, and appendChild were key. Understanding their syntax really enables you to get through this challenge.
- It is necessary to be mindful of your code in all three HTML, CSS, and JS files and how they interact with one another. Particularly, reusing a class so that one line of CSS can refer to multiple dynamically-generated examples was especially useful.
- A major aspect of this challenge was the balance between figuring out which solution made sense and the solution that would be most efficient. While there may have been other approaches that would've resulted in shorter code, my approach made sense to me and still worked. One of my future goals is to improve my code refactoring skills, but for now, I decided to prioritize functionality.
- Sometimes, I found it helpful to walk away from the screen and think through my problem in a different location. This would relax and reset my mind so that I can better evaluate the problem and even come up with creative solutions.
